# Challenges
In this repository, you will find examples of coding challenges that we would like to run using your technology.

- Following a nested structure, each folder matches one module and contains multiple exercices with their test files.
- Tests need to be run in order to validate the exercise.
- The solutions are hosted into an other repository and available later to the students.
